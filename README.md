# QuickConsoleApp
 
 Just a simple console app that automates the process of creating an empty C# .Net 6 Console application and opening it in VSCode.
 It prompts for a Project Name and asks if this is a personal project or not.
 There are 2 configuration options in the appSettings.json file which are used to define where projects are saved.
 
 It uses the CliWrap https://github.com/Tyrrrz/CliWrap library
